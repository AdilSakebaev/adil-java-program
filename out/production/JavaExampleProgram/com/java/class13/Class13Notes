String - Immutable
Immutable - We cannot change value of String once we initialized in the memory
String str1 = "Hello";
// Here we're storing constant value "Hello" into the String variable so it'll get store into the String pool memory
String str2 = new String("Hello);
// Here we're creating an object of String with the value "Hello" so it'll get stored in heap memory
String str3 = sc.nextLine();
// Here we're trying to get value "Hello" from user using scanner class so it'll also get stored into heap memory
==> When we compare String with '==' it'll just compare the memory location of two String
==> When we create two String variables with the same constant value, java will create one value in String pool memory and
both variables will point to the same memory location because it has same value. So comparing that variables using '=='
will give you true
